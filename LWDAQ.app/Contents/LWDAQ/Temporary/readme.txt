This directory is used for temporary files. In particular, when LWDAQ spawns a
new process, it writes to this directory the configuration file for that
process. For example, when LWDAQ spawns a Neuroplayer, Neurorecorder, or
Videoarchiver, it writes a configuration file to this directory. This readme
file serves as a reliable anchor for the Temporary directory. With a at least
one file in this directory, git will be sure to include it in the repository.
