Meta description     A numeric array extension for Tcl with support for vectors,
Meta description     matrices and higher-rank tensors of integers, floating point
Meta description     and complex numbers. VecTcl has builtin support for array
Meta description     shaping, slicing and common linear algebra subroutines.
Meta description     Arrays are represented as nested lists with an optimized
Meta description     internal data storage. Therefore, seamless integration with
Meta description     Tcl and other packages like math::linearalgebra is ensured
Meta description     while good performance is provided. The user interface
Meta description     consists of a single command, vexpr, which acts as an
Meta description     expression evaluator similar to expr. The language supported
Meta description     by vexpr is closely modelled after commercial linear algebra
Meta description     packages and the syntax used by textbooks.
