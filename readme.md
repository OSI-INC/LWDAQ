# LWDAQ

The Long-Wire Data Acquisition ([LWDAQ](http://www.bndhep.net/Electronics/LWDAQ/Manual.html)) software acquires, displays, analyzes and records data acquired with LWDAQ hardware, such as the Brandeis CCD Angle Monitor ([BCAM](http://www.bndhep.net/Devices/BCAM/User_Manual.html)), LWDAQ Driver ([A2071E](http://www.bndhep.net/Electronics/A2071/M2071.html)), Octal Data Receiver ([A2037E](http://www.opensourceinstruments.com/Electronics/A3027/M3027.html)), or Laboratory Camera ([A2075A](http://www.bndhep.net/Electronics/A2075/M2075.html)). The program runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. You can download the zip-archive, multi-platform distribution of the latest version of LWDAQ from our [Software Downlod](http://www.bndhep.net/Software/Download/) page.
